# Getting Started with Reaction

This project was created by Will Wardrop as a front-end capstone project at the Nashville Software School.

## Project Description
Reaction is a web application that provides analytical and pipeline management tools to commercial real estate professionals.  The purpose of Reaction is to fill a need in the commercial real estate industry for a tool that can geographically display and manage project pipelines.  The application tracks three property types which include multifamily, office, and industrial types. Features include dynamic project maps with Goole Map integration, a property-specific task manager, multifamily property rent and occupacny charts, and other property type-specific information.  Also included is a note manager that utilizes user location to provide locations of potential projects the user comes across during the day.

## Motivation

This project was completed as a capstone project for the client-side portion of the Full-Stack Web Development program at the Nashville Software School. The project was inspired by past experiences and a passion for locational data.


I previously worked as a commercial real estate analyst in Nashville.  Nashville is currently booming and development is expanding at a rapid pace.  Keeping track of the development pipeline was basically a full time job in itself and there was no single, easy-to-use application that provided the tools to track and map the development pipeline.

Reaction is the first iteration of what I hope will eventually become a full-featured real estate application with commercial viability.


## How It Works
Users can create a profile using just a name and email.  The site is not secured so I would advise using a fake email address.

Once logged in, users will be taken to their personalized dashboard that features overview statistics, multifamily graphs for portfolio rent and occupancy over time, an overview of tasks from all properties, and a navigation bar.

The navivation bar includes a property map, that will display all properties in the users portfolio on a customized Google Map.  Next to the property map is a Notes section that will display a map of all user notes.  To the right of Notes is the add property dropdown that allows the user to add a property after selecting the type of property being added.  Finally, on the far right is a log out button that will log the user out and redirect them to the log in page.

## Access

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
