# Getting Started with Reaction

This project was created by Will Wardrop as a front-end capstone project at the Nashville Software School.

## Project Description
Reaction is a web application that provides analytical and pipeline management tools to commercial real estate professionals.  The purpose of Reaction is to fill a need in the commercial real estate industry for a tool that can geographically display and manage project pipelines.  The application tracks three property types which include multifamily, office, and industrial types. Features include dynamic project maps with Goole Map integration, a property-specific task manager, multifamily property rent and occupacny charts, and other property type-specific information.  Also included is a note manager that utilizes user location to provide locations of potential projects the user comes across during the day.

## Motivation

This project was completed as a capstone project for the client-side portion of the Full-Stack Web Development program at the Nashville Software School. The project was inspired by past experiences in commercial real estate and a passion for locational data.


I previously worked as a commercial real estate analyst in Nashville.  Nashville is currently booming and development is expanding at a rapid pace.  Keeping track of the development pipeline is a major undertaking and there was no single, easy-to-use application that provided the tools to track and map the development pipeline.

Reaction is the first iteration of what I hope will eventually become a full-featured real estate application with commercial viability.


## How It Works
Users can create a profile using just a name and email.  The site is not secured so I would advise using a fake email address.

Once logged in, users will be taken to their personalized dashboard that features overview statistics, multifamily graphs for portfolio rent and occupancy over time, an overview of tasks from all properties, and a navigation bar.

The navivation bar includes a property map, that will display all properties in the users portfolio on a customized Google Map.  Next to the property map is a Notes section that will display a map of all user notes.  To the right of Notes is the add property dropdown that allows the user to add a property after selecting the type of property being added.  Finally, on the far right is a log out button that will log the user out and redirect them to the log in page.
